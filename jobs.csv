Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).About The RoleImagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen one before. That's what we're trying to do at Notion — make software that feels timeless, with the craftsmanship of German cameras, playfulness of Japanese toys, and mass appeal of Coca-Cola. We have no end of fascinating challenges that can only be solved by someone with innate product & UX sense, technical aptitude, great taste, and impeccable craft.What You'll AchieveDesign product concepts that balance vision, craft, speed, and business potential.Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.Run projects end to end with engineers to drive your vision to the ship line.Partner closely with our Customer Experience, Sales, and Customer Success teams to understand what each of our diverse user segments need, want, and love about Notion.

You design using best practices and advocate for the best user experience.You care about business needs, implications, and the practicality of your solutions and work to deliver clear, intuitive, and appealing human interfaces that blend seamlessly into the Notion UI.You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.You understand how to tell stories using both words and visuals, and strategize the best ways to drive alignment.You value working cross-functionally with project management, engineering, research and data — as well as design peers.Nice To HavesYou've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. We're looking to build a diverse team where our skills and experience can complement each other.You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.You're familiar with the work of computing heroes like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Bret Victor, etc. — and understand why we're big fans.You are a designer who can code!We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.
