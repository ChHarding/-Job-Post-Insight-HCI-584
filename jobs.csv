There’s a ton of room for you to have an outsized impact on our trajectory and do the best work of your career.Product Design @ CommandBarDesigning product at CommandBar is a uniquely interesting and challenging role. We design primarily for two different audiences.First are the builders – the product managers, engineers, designers, and product marketers that are creating best-in-class onboarding flows, in-app surveys, and AI copilot experiences. In a space that’s traditionally bloated and complex, we design simple opinionated tools that help builders create great experiences by default, with minimal fuss.We also serve our customers’ customers.

A strong product design portfolio that spikes in at least a few areas: visual design, UI design, systems design, product thinking, prototyping, and interaction design. Ability to break down large design solutions into smaller stackable and testable experiences. Desire for extreme ownership. You should be comfortable moving ideas forward and default to asking for forgiveness. Experience working remotely.

Meanwhile, most lenders aren’t helping their existing or potential borrowers through education and guidance the way they should.We are changing this relationship! Hundreds of leading lenders rely on award-winning technologies from TrustEngine to build lasting borrower relationships that maximize lifetime customer value for the lender and empower the borrower. We are reimagining the lending and financial space by connecting borrowers with the right loan at the right time. Our team is always on the lookout for passionate and hardworking members who can help take us to the next level in helping borrowers achieve their goals.About the Role:We’re looking for a designer that loves the message and the experience as much as the aesthetic. So many jobs out there are looking for UX/UI designers and while knowledge of both of those is important, this role is about designing advertising creatives and UI in smart ways that allow them to scale while working with the product, marketing, and sales teams to highlight our unique benefits through top tier visuals.The first major project we’re looking to tackle is a library of borrower experiences through advertising creatives that express the benefits that they can receive from purchasing a new home or refinancing their current home…or even, in some cases, waiting until a better time. Your expertise will also be used to guide our product teams towards the best user experiences.We are looking for an experienced, entrepreneurial, hands-on designer who loves to test and iterate on designs using both user tests and A/B testing to continuously improve the messaging and experience. You’ll be a solo designer, but you’ll be surrounded by a team that is passionate about delivering great experiences and continuously reaching new levels of learning and quality. In addition, you’ll be reporting to the VP of Product, who has a background in design and running creative teams.We work fast and agile, so flexibility and incrementality is a key mindset for this role. Move fast, be imperfect, but be honest about the imperfection as we get better. Your designs will be used to communicate the value our business delivers and you’ll continuously have a chance to one-up yourself.Responsibilities:Ability to create processes that make design scalable and repeatable once we identify the right path, including prototypes, asset libraries, and specifications for repeatabilityEvolve our design system to support advertising creatives for our customers and the borrowers they serveConnecting dots with data to create better experiences that inspire our users to interactPartner with product, engineering, and omni-channel to identify user needs, prioritize work, then set and achieve goalsBring new ideas to the table that could stretch the thinking of the rest of the teamExcited to solve hard problems and the ability to push through when inspiration is out of reach RequirementsA portfolio that shows off your product design and your iterative approach Master of design and prototyping tools, specifically Figma, though Sketch or Adobe XD can translateDeep understanding of user-centered design, information architecture, and interaction designA passion for using design to create results and questioning why, when the results don’t align with the hypothesis - then creating new design to test those new assumptionsA strong passion for and extensive experience in investigating and answering hard business questions with dataHTML, CSS, and Javascript experience a big plusThe role would benefit in experience from working in creative services, the mortgage industry, or on a SaaS product, but is not a requirementA degree or equivalent experience in HCD, HCI, service design, or experience designBenefitsOur benefits include but are not limited to the following: 100% company paid medical; company matching 401(k), paid maternity and paternity leave, unlimited FTO package, ongoing professional development and certification opportunities, competitive salary, special employee discounts and health and wellness perks."

Need someone who can build in XD and ideally someone who also has had experience building design systems in Figma and got ""all nerdy"" with it. Some understanding of front end development and design, someone with a good visual understanding of scale and how things come together. Passion around order, structure and process etc. to help support. Need to run at a good pace, not someone too JR. Someone who can pick up and run with Figma as they build. Understand the code, look at what's happening and how it will work. Not as a developer but has the understanding. Also someone who has an understanding of design systems and build the components. Understanding accessibility guidelines. The design system really is the project for the team. eCommerce experience they are creating and component comes together to create. A button you click to make a purchase is a component, a table where you're comparing prices, is a component. The design system is managing all the library of information that the teams use to build their screens. There are some technical aspects to be leveraged in Figma, and they want to leverage those. Someone highly capable, but might not have been doing in recently, as long as they have a good understanding in Figma, they can probably pick up and learn quickly, that would be OK. Having a background in code is helpful. How can we design the components in the tool so they can be easy to use, so the designers to use, like the color, size, shape, etc. From a portfolio perspective, examples of experience in design systems would be a plus to have. There are a lot of people out there who are all marketing designers, but probably not right for this – unless they have built an eCommerce Design System. Don't need heavy UX designer, this is more of a UI role. Definitely digital design experience though. eCommerce experience is not mandatory. They are very data-driven, it's not like buying a purse or shoes, it's prescription data numbers info that's given. Although it's eCommerce, it's not exactly the same. They don't feel like the industry experience matters, but definitely need to have digital experience, any type of digital."

About Our Client: We are the movement to make people matter more than money in our democracy. We’re building a movement and free tech to end America's two-party political dysfunction.Americans are losing faith in democracy – especially young people. The rigged, two party system has turned Independent into a dirty word to make voters trapped between voting for the lesser of two evils or wasting their vote on an alternative.

We connect our supporters to people-powered and anti-corruption Good Candidates who will truly represent us in office.We recognize that Independent and 3rd party candidates lack the resources to be viable against Republicans and Democrats, even though a majority of Americans identify as Independent. In fact, a majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans, nor Democrats represent them…but they keep getting elected!Our solution is to provide graduates of our academy, and candidates around the country who take our pledge , with cutting-edge tech tools to win, without selling out to the Democrats or Republicans.

About Our Client: We are the movement to make people matter more than money in our democracy. We’re building a movement and free tech to end America's two-party political dysfunction.Americans are losing faith in democracy – especially young people.
