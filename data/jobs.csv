You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.You understand how to tell stories using both words and visuals, and strategize the best ways to drive alignment.You value working cross-functionally with project management, engineering, research and data — as well as design peers.Nice To HavesYou've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team.
