## Job Post Insight
The app will be a job post analyzing tool where it will analyze the current job posts available and give insights. The app will scrape job websites to find new job opportunities and collect data to keep track of hiring trends. It will analyze the level of experience, key qualifications, salary range, benefit, and number of new posts, repost of a certain job function.

### Potential User
My primary user would be someone who is actively looking for a job. The secondary user may be someone who is still in school and deciding their career.

### Problem
Job hunting can be tough. It is even harder when job posts are not standardized. Each job board has its own standards and there is no perfect one that allows an user to find the exact match.
This app will help users quickly know more about the job and its match to the user without having to read through the job description, and more importantly, to see hiring trends and other insight.

### Workflow
I imagined this app being a website with a dashboard, showing daily new jobs, and flag any reposts, or job posts that weren’t actually hiring. The user can search for position name or certain skill to find the job. The dashboard will show list of job posts, it’s sources, and an overview of the trend.
