Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).About The RoleImagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen one before. That's what we're trying to do at Notion — make software that feels timeless, with the craftsmanship of German cameras, playfulness of Japanese toys, and mass appeal of Coca-Cola. We have no end of fascinating challenges that can only be solved by someone with innate product & UX sense, technical aptitude, great taste, and impeccable craft.What You'll AchieveDesign product concepts that balance vision, craft, speed, and business potential.Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.Run projects end to end with engineers to drive your vision to the ship line.Partner closely with our Customer Experience, Sales, and Customer Success teams to understand what each of our diverse user segments need, want, and love about Notion.

You design using best practices and advocate for the best user experience.You care about business needs, implications, and the practicality of your solutions and work to deliver clear, intuitive, and appealing human interfaces that blend seamlessly into the Notion UI.You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.You understand how to tell stories using both words and visuals, and strategize the best ways to drive alignment.You value working cross-functionally with project management, engineering, research and data — as well as design peers.Nice To HavesYou've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. We're looking to build a diverse team where our skills and experience can complement each other.You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.You're familiar with the work of computing heroes like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Bret Victor, etc. — and understand why we're big fans.You are a designer who can code!We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

We connect our supporters to these Good Candidates who will truly represent us in office.Americans are losing faith in democracy – especially young people. The rigged, two party system has turned Independent into a dirty word to make voters trapped between voting for the lesser of two evils or wasting their vote on an alternative. Whether you’re concerned about the climate, privacy, inequality, or our individual freedoms, solutions are held back by the dark doom-loop of dysfunctional partisan politics.We recognize that Independent and 3rd party candidates lack the resources to be viable against Republicans and Democrats, even though a majority of Americans are Independent. In fact, a majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans, nor Democrats represent them…but they keep getting elected!Good Party’s solution is to provide candidates who take our pledge with cutting-edge tech tools to win, without selling out to the Democrats or Republicans. We are building a community to end the corrupt two party system and then harnessing that community’s collective power to elect the most promising independents around the country. By leveraging social media and creators, we’re making our mission to make people matter more than money mainstream.Good Party is founded by serial entrepreneur, Farhad Mohit, with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate.Why you should work at Good Party:Join us in solving the biggest problem of our time – fixing our democracy – so all other problems can be solvedWe’re a Public Benefit Corporation that prioritizes social impact over profitInnovative Bitcoin denominated deferred bonus plan, allowing you to have the amazing upside of being in a startup while working on a truly meaningful missionWork where and how you like, on a fully remote team spread across the countryJoin a passionate team with diverse political views focused on one mission100% coverage of health, dental, and vision benefits for you and your dependentsWe encourage you to take time off to recharge and have an unlimited PTO (sick and vacation) policy.

If you prefer co-working, that’s an option we can discuss too.Fully funded for our mission. No stressing over whether the next round of funding will come through. Focus on making an impact. That’s what matters here.What you’ll do:Turn product requirements into world-class designs, user flows, interfaces, and promotional collateral to empower candidates, voters, and volunteers.Champion an iterative, fast-paced, data-driven design philosophy – prototype, user test, launch, and learn from data plus user feedback to iterate further.Partner closely with Head of Design, Product Manager, and Development team to produce well-designed solutions and bring them to life.Leverage your user obsession to deeply understand Good Party’s user personas, help devise user testing experiments that reveal more insights, and quickly utilize inputs for iterative implementation.Design in live (remote) collaboration sessions with Good Party’s Founder for ideation, iterations, and edits.Partner with Marketing to continuously improve Good Party’s brand and visual identity on social platforms and collateral (merch, posters, etc.)Who we’re looking for:You’re up for the audacious challenge of transforming our democracy for Good.A great day for you involves lots of hands-on time in Figma. You love digging into a project and quickly turning out iterations to test. You’re well versed in balancing your creative drive to explore many possibilities with the speed needs of a startup.You’re a proven A-player with a 5+ year track record of innovative design, increasing responsibility, and impact, ideally within startups or small organizations.

You keep up with emerging patterns and trends in UI/UX.You have high empathy and want to understand what will drive people to become engaged candidates, voters, and volunteers. Given the range of natural skepticism to cynicism about politics, you understand the importance of meeting people where they’re at and the power of simple design to change hearts and minds.You’re able to work independently plus willing to collaborate with others to iteratively solve problems in real-time. You like jumping on a quick Zoom to figure something out together.You thrive working at startup speed. Our solution is desperately needed and the issues of our time are all bottlenecked by our corrupted democracy.You align with our team’s values: We Are – Honest, open, and mission-driven.
